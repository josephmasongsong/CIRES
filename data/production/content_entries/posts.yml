    body: "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">CIRES works with residents, local groups - like
      Exchange\r\nInner City - the business improvement associations and others to
      assess gaps in\r\nthe provision of goods and services to community members and
      chooses tenants\r\nbased on this feedback. CIRES is proud to report that its
      portfolio has achieved\r\na 92% occupancy rate and has a significant waiting
      list of prospective tenants.\r\nThis is a testament to the efficacy of the organization
      moving rapidly to meet\r\ncommunity needs and an indication of the high demand
      for affordable space.\r\nCIRES also uses revenue generated from tenants paying
      market rates to provide\r\nstrategic grants and investments in its non-market
      tenants, local social\r\nenterprises and other community economic development
      initiatives. In this past\r\nyear that has amounted to over $550,000. CIRES
      staff have also provided a range\r\ncapacity building supports and other in-kind
      enterprise development services to\r\nour non-market tenants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"MsoNormal\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Real Estate affordability
      is one of the most challenging\r\nissues for residents and businesses alike.
      However, CIRES firmly believes that\r\nreal estate can also provide a solution
      to many of the pressing economic\r\nchallenges facing Vancouver’s inner-city.
      Leveraging provincially owned assets\r\nhas ensured that residents continue
      to have access to affordable goods and services,\r\nemployment opportunities

    body: "<p>Steve began his career in community economic development at Dixon Hall
      in Toronto, where he played a key role in building and supporting innovative
      programming for at-risk residents in the inner city. He relocated to Vancouver
      in 2014 to lead Tradeworks Training Society, where he guided the growth and
      revitalization of the agency’s critical employment and social enterprise programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </p><p>Steve currently serves as Director of Exchange Inner City, a collaborative
      network of over 55 organizations and individuals working in Vancouver’s inner
      city to foster a vibrant and inclusive local economy. He also works concurrently
      at the City of Vancouver’s Social Planning Department and led the development
      of Vancouver’s Community Benefit Agreement policy. He serves on a number of
      community boards, including the Advisory Board of the Binners’ Project, and
      is a mentor to many organizations in the Downtown Eastside.&nbsp;</p><p>CIRES
      Board member Mary Clare Zak said, “Steve’s passion for community building, his
      experience in social enterprise, and his ability to bring people together from
      all walks of life are exactly what we need to lead CIRES forward.” <br><br>Steve
      will succeed CIRES’ founding Executive Director David LePage and Managing Director
      Shaugn Schwartz. David and Shaugn are respected social enterprise leaders and
      community builders who were recruited to take CIRES from a concept to a thriving
      start-up social enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p></p><p>“On behalf of the Board,
      I would like express our profound gratitude to David and Shaugn for having made
      CIRES a reality. They are leaving a strong foundation to realize our vision
      for CIRES as a catalyst for building a vibrant, inclusive economy in the Downtown
      Eastside,” said Mary Clare Zak.&nbsp;</p><p>Steve was recruited through an extensive
      national search led by Realize Strategies, an award-winning B Corporation boutique
      consulting firm based in Vancouver that provides trusted business insights and
      customized solutions to purpose-driven organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Steve
      will formally assume the Executive Director role on June 10, 2019. <br></p>"

    body: "<p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>Vancouver is now home to the first biometric opioid vending
      machine, the latest harm reduction strategy in the ongoing opioid crisis.</p><p>The
      vending machine, located in the city’s Downtown Eastside at 60 Hastings Street
      next to an overdose prevention site, was launched by the <a target=\"_blank\"
      href=\"https://twitter.com/MySafeProject\">MySafe Project</a>, which is led
      by Dr. Mark Tyndall, a professor of medicine at UBC’s School of Population and
      Public Health. Tyndall showed how it works in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://vimeo.com/377612110\"
      title=\"Link: https://vimeo.com/377612110\" rel=\"noopener\">video</a>&nbsp;posted
      on social media this week.</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>The 800-pound machine works
      kind of like an ATM to dispense a medicinal alternative to heroin called hydromorphone
      to people who are registered, opioid users. It scans the vein pattern in a person’s
      palm and then dispenses a small box with a safe dose of hydromorphone. MySafe
      is also developing an app so people can track their drug use.</p><p>Tyndall
      said they do a medical assessment and write a prescription and the drugs are
      covered through the person’s Pharmacare plan. &nbsp;He said this works for the
      pilot program, but they may need another plan if the model is scaled up.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I
      believe if you allow people to stabilize their routine a little bit more by
      having a secure safe place where they can get their drugs, and cut into the
      other activities that they might have to do to get their drugs, then there will
      be much more time for connection,” said Tyndall, in the video.\r\n\r\n<br><p></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>The
      machine is available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., but Tyndall said it is very secure
      and he believes it would be beneficial to make it available for 24 hours so
      people could access it at night.</p><p>Tyndall, who has been working with the
      Downtown Eastside community for 30 years, said he chose people to participate
      in the program that he knew were at high risk for a fentanyl overdose.</p><p>“I
      was afraid that I would wake up in the morning and hear they had overdosed.
      They are people with a history of an overdose and tested for fentanyl in their
      urine, so they are high risk.”</p><p>“The biggest challenge we have had is people
      using drugs in a room by themselves. So with this, they can continue using alone
      without the risk of overdose. They can come, get their medication, and then
      take it with them.”</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>Tyndall said giving people a regulated
      and safer drug supply stops overdoses and gives people their lives back.</p><p>“There
      are two points to a safe supply. One is the obvious thing that on one hand you
      have deadly fentanyl and the other hand you have a pharmaceutical drug with
      a known dosage, the person who takes the known dosage will not overdose,” he
      said.</p><p>The eight-milligram hydromorphone pills cost about 35 cents each
      and focus groups with drug users have suggested most people would need about
      10 to 16 pills a day, according to Tyndall.</p><p>He said hydromorphone is typically
      crushed and injected by people who may have previously used OxyContin before
      that drug was made more difficult to tamper with following multiple fatal overdoses.</p><p>Tyndall
      is conducting the research independently in his role as a UBC professor and
      the Ministry of Health and Addictions is not involved.</p><p>“As with any independent
      research, we will await the results,” said a statement from the ministry. “Patient
      and community safety and well-being is of the utmost importance in all work
      to respond to the poisoned drug supply. The Ministry is focused on our own work
      to scale up access to medically-supervised prescription alternatives to toxic
      street drugs as just one part of establishing a full continuum of care and delivering
      an urgent, comprehensive response to this crisis, including prevention, enforcement,
      harm reduction and treatment and recovery.”</p><p>More than 5,000 people have
      died in the overdose crisis in B.C. since 2016.</p>\r\n\r\nSource: <a href=\"@MySafeProject\">Vancouver

      Irving Hotel located at 390 Columbia Street on January 1st.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>"
    featured_image: "/samples/_production/content_entries/SarahBlythJacketDesk.jpg"
    body: "<p>\r\n\r\nAfter a busy year, OPS founding member Sarah Blyth says the
      new art-filled space is a welcome change.\r\nThe move is coming in the midst
      of a terrible year for overdose deaths in British Columbia. With borders closed
      because of COVID-19, the illicit drug supply has become more toxic than ever.&nbsp;With
      an average of 140 deaths in the first 11 months of 2020, B.C. is on track to
      record 1,688 deaths from toxic drugs by the end of this year. The trend is a
      reverse of what happened in 2019 when drug poisoning deaths fell for the first
      time in four years.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p>The Overdose Prevention Society
      started during the fall of 2016, with just a tent and volunteers who could administer
      first aid and naloxone — an overdose reversal drug — if clients overdosed. The
      service it offered was technically illegal, but with deaths mounting the B.C.
      government quickly got on board to support the model.</p><p>Two supervised injection
      sites had already been operating in Vancouver since the early 2000s, but the
      process to open new sites was onerous, with operators required to jump through
      many bureaucratic hoops.</p><p>The OPS showed how more sites could be opened
      quickly to meet demand as using drugs became more dangerous across Canada.</p><p>Standing
      in the bright L-shaped space at 390 Columbia Street, Blyth said 2020 has been
      difficult. The overdoses that staff were seeing were more complicated because
      of the addition of benzodiazepines, a type of drug that often puts people into
      deep unconsciousness and can’t be counteracted with naloxone. Drugs are often
      contaminated with both benzos and fentanyl, Blyth said.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p><p>“The
      overdose doesn’t just end with Narcan,” Blyth said, using the brand name for
      naloxone. “They’ll be completely comatose with the benzos. That adds caretaking
      for folks throughout the day.”</p><p>Policies put in place to restrict the spread
      of COVID-19 have also reduced the number of shelter spots and drop-in spaces
      for people who are unhoused or precariously housed.</p><p>The overdose prevention
      site, which stayed open to offer life-saving services, has filled in some of
      the gaps. That includes distributing food, helping people find housing, and
      giving out tents, blankets and sleeping bags.</p><p>The new space is also filled
      with work from the many artists who make their home in the Downtown Eastside
      — from city scenes by Ken Foster to graffiti art by Smokey D and BOY, to landscapes
      by Stephen Saulnier (check out the Facebook page <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/DTESArtistsCollective\"

      says overdose prevention sites can act as a gateway to get people connected
      to health and housing services, and there should be more of them.&nbsp;<p></p><p></p><p>Blyth
      called overdose prevention sites “the frontlines to the people who are using
      drugs.”</p><p>“People feel safe when they come in — it’s a great way to start
      the first bond with people to earn their trust when they haven’t had a lot of
      trust in the systems,” Blyth said.</p><p>“You can meet people where they’re
      at, and then you can connect them with services. We get people housing, we get
      people food, we get people clothing. If you get <a href=\"https://thetyee.ca/News/2020/09/16/Safe-Supply-Expansion/\"

    body: "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">CIRES works with residents, local groups - like
      Exchange\r\nInner City - the business improvement associations and others to
      assess gaps in\r\nthe provision of goods and services to community members and
      chooses tenants\r\nbased on this feedback. CIRES is proud to report that its
      portfolio has achieved\r\na 92% occupancy rate and has a significant waiting
      list of prospective tenants.\r\nThis is a testament to the efficacy of the organization
      moving rapidly to meet\r\ncommunity needs and an indication of the high demand
      for affordable space.\r\nCIRES also uses revenue generated from tenants paying
      market rates to provide\r\nstrategic grants and investments in its non-market
      tenants, local social\r\nenterprises and other community economic development
      initiatives. In this past\r\nyear that has amounted to over $550,000. CIRES
      staff have also provided a range\r\ncapacity building supports and other in-kind
      enterprise development services to\r\nour non-market tenants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"MsoNormal\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Real Estate affordability
      is one of the most challenging\r\nissues for residents and businesses alike.
      However, CIRES firmly believes that\r\nreal estate can also provide a solution
      to many of the pressing economic\r\nchallenges facing Vancouver’s inner-city.
      Leveraging provincially owned assets\r\nhas ensured that residents continue
      to have access to affordable goods and services,\r\nemployment opportunities

      for the Downtown Eastside Street Market say it’s being unfairly painted as a
      hub for stolen goods, and that closing it down would be a disaster for low-income
      people who rely on buying and selling everything from sneakers, to DVDs, to
      chocolate bars and canned food.\r\n\r\n<br></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>The Vancouver
      Police Department held a press conference on Dec. 6 to reveal the results of
      a months-long “sting” operation involving undercover officers. Police said their
      investigation showed stolen goods are regularly flowing through the market and
      the unofficial street vending spots that pop up nearby.</p><p>The investigation
      resulted in multiple charges being laid against two men police allege are tied
      to large criminal networks responsible for an “epidemic” of property theft in
      downtown Vancouver.</p><p>Nezamoddin Jelali has been charged with three counts
      of possession of stolen property and one count of trafficking stolen property,
      while Aaron Castillo-Anguiano has been charged with three counts of possession
      of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking and two counts of possession
      of the proceeds of crime.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolice say they are unable to say
      whether the two accused were operating inside the city-funded Downtown Eastside
      market, which is set up in a vacant lot at 25 E. Hastings St., or outside the
      market on East Hastings Street, where vending also takes place, but is not controlled
      by market staff.\r\n\r\n<br><p></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>VPD Insp. Alison Laurin
      said the Downtown Eastside market has changed over several years, evolving from
      an “informal binners’ market” to “a place where criminal organizations have
      pushed their way in.” She also said the selling of stolen goods in the impoverished
      neighbourhood is “fuelling the epidemic of shoplifting and break-ins in the
      north half of the city.”</p><p>Vancouver Coun. Melissa De Genova suggested in
      an interview with Global News that “this could put an end to the Downtown Eastside
      Street Market.”</p><p>De Genova told The Tyee she doesn’t think the city should
      be funding the sale of stolen goods.</p><p>“We need better checks and balances,
      like the system for pawnshops, and we need to find a better way to support legitimate
      sales at the market,” she said. “There can be a market, but we need to end the
      sale of stolen goods.”</p><p>The Downtown Eastside Street Market receives $300,000
      a year from the City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Community Network has a
      municipal contract to manage the market. According to city staff, that funding
      includes stipends for peer workers who staff the market.</p><p>Community advocates
      say the police press conference and the Global News video story that depicted
      the Downtown Eastside Street Market as being rife with stolen goods leave the
      wrong impression, and once again perpetuate harmful stereotypes about people
      living in poverty. In the Global News story, Laurin was shown walking inside
      the market and pointing out tables with goods that were likely stolen, but none
      of the vendors or market organizers were interviewed.</p><p>“It’s really unfortunate,
      because it puts a really good community initiative in jeopardy and it saves
      people’s lives in so many different ways,” said Sarah Blyth, the executive director
      of the Overdose Prevention Society. Several years ago, Blyth was involved in
      running the market when it was located near 58 E. Hastings St. “People go back
      to doing survival sex work, people will go back to doing all kinds of stuff
      if they don’t have these types of avenues.”</p><p></p><p>Police say marginalized
      people who live in the Downtown Eastside are being recruited to shoplift or
      break into businesses to steal items, which are then moved through the local
      open-air markets. Many of the items then end up on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace,
      according to police.</p><p>Linda Lennie is a DTES resident who started vending
      in 2009 and now works at the Downtown Eastside Street Market. She said the police
      and the Global News story left the impression that the market has been taken
      over by organized crime, which is not the case.</p><p>“When the market first
      started, it took us a long time to get past that stigma of being a stolen goods
      market,” Lennie said. “Then we cleaned it up, and now they’re trying to put
      that stigma back on.”</p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p>Lennie said she and other staff at
      the market patrol the tables regularly, have a contraband list and ask people
      to leave if it appears they are selling stolen items. People are also not allowed
      to do drugs or sell drugs inside the market.</p><p>The market helps people who
      are on fixed incomes such as a pension or social assistance make some extra
      money, Lennie said, but more than that, it provides a safe place where people
      can get out of their tiny single-room occupancy hotel units and connect with
      other people.</p><p>“When I first started coming to the market, [it was] to
      get myself out of my depression, to get myself out of my room,” Lennie said.
      “A lot of the people are doing that now. They need social interaction just to
      get themselves out.”</p><p>Even though she has a job at the market, Lennie still
      struggles with the stresses of poverty. She recently became homeless after losing
      her housing, and now lives at the market site full time.</p><p>Antonio Macias,
      a vendor at the market, acknowledges stolen goods do show up, but said most
      of the problems are linked to the illicit drug trade and happen outside the
      market, on East Hastings Street.</p><p>“Many people, instead of doing drugs
      outside, they come in here to sell things, Macias said. “I think it’s a good
      thing, but [there are] bad things too, because people steal from big houses
      and bring here to sell for drugs.”</p><p>Overall, he still thinks the market
      is a positive thing for the neighbourhood and the city.</p><p>Constance Barnes,
      a former Vancouver parks board commissioner, was the director of the market
      in 2019 and early 2020, but the position was cut when the market — then located
      at 58 W. Hastings St. — was shut down for several months at the beginning of
      the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>When it came to controlling the sale of stolen
      goods at the market, Barnes said she worked on prevention rather than enforcement.
      With police, she developed a system of marking items that were donated.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>“We
      would stamp it with this little kind of a stamp... and then you could refer
      to the stamp in the blue binder and they could look and say, ‘OK, this is all
      donated,’” Barnes said.</p><p>Sometimes, people who had items stolen from their
      vehicle would come to the market in search of the goods, and Barnes said she
      was able to get vendors to return stolen items, adding the the problem was rooted
      in poverty and addiction.</p><p>“We had a good kind of collaborative way to
      deal with it, without it getting ugly, without having to call the police, and
      the product being returned,” Barnes said.</p><p>Both Barnes and Blyth said that
      when they ran the market, they were able to get donations of new items from
      the film industry, liquidators or other sources. They emphasized that just because
      items look new or clothing still has tags, that doesn’t mean they’re stolen.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile,
      the market has yet to find a permanent location, having been relocated from
      site to site in the neighbourhood. The city has identified 525 Powell St. as
      a location the market can move to permanently in the next three to five years.</p><p>Considering
      the other problems the neighbourhood has been facing, Blyth said the way the
      market has been depicted is disappointing. The Downtown Eastside has been hit
      hard by the <a href=\"https://thetyee.ca/News/2021/12/09/Government-Policies-Blamed-Toxic-Drug-Deaths-Soar/\">soaring
      number</a>&nbsp;of overdose deaths in 2020 and 2021.</p><p>“We’re living in
      COVID-19, we’re living with funerals happening every day, and people dying and
      desperate situations,” she said. “The real issue is poverty and people dying.”</p><p>Laurin
      said the VPD will now be working with the city and the Vancouver Community Network
      on the stolen goods problem.</p><p>“It is my hope that together, we’ll be able
      to weed out the criminal enterprises that have taken over much of the space
      in and around the market and restore it as a trading space for Downtown Eastsiders,
      as it was originally intended to be,” she said.&nbsp;<br></p><p>&lt; end &gt;&nbsp;<br></p><p>\r\n\r\n</p><p><i>Source:

      Exchange\r\nInner City - the business improvement associations and others to
      assess gaps in\r\nthe provision of goods and services to community members and
      chooses tenants\r\nbased on this feedback. CIRES is proud to report that its
      portfolio has achieved\r\na 92% occupancy rate and has a significant waiting
      list of prospective tenants.\r\nThis is a testament to the efficacy of the organization
      moving rapidly to meet\r\ncommunity needs and an indication of the high demand
      for affordable space.\r\nCIRES also uses revenue generated from tenants paying
      market rates to provide\r\nstrategic grants and investments in its non-market
      tenants, local social\r\nenterprises and other community economic development
      initiatives. In this past\r\nyear that has amounted to over $550,000. CIRES
      staff have also provided a range\r\ncapacity building supports and other in-kind
      enterprise development services to\r\nour non-market tenants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"MsoNormal\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Real Estate affordability
      is one of the most challenging\r\nissues for residents and businesses alike.
      However, CIRES firmly believes that\r\nreal estate can also provide a solution
      to many of the pressing economic\r\nchallenges facing Vancouver’s inner-city.
      Leveraging provincially owned assets\r\nhas ensured that residents continue
      to have access to affordable goods and services,\r\nemployment opportunities
      and healthier communities. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p

      Water Street in Gastown and we're thrilled that they get to operate in a high-foot-traffic
      neighbourhood at non-market rent. \r\n\r\nWhile we've been working closely with
      BC Housing to bring valuable community benefits to the residents of the DTES,
      CIRES is not quite “a subsidiary” close. Established in 2016, CIRES is a non-profit
      society - independent from any third party - that supports thriving, equitable
      and inclusive local economies and communities by curating a balanced portfolio
      of commercial spaces. \r\n\r\n</p><p><i>\"Little Mountain’s original location,
      nestled on East 26th Avenue, around the corner from Main Street, provided the
      only dose of regular entertainment in an otherwise quiet neighbourhood. It was
      one of the few consistent comedy rooms in Vancouver, alongside the Comedy Mix
      and Yuk Yuk’s.</i><br><br><i>Now, with those other two rooms closed for good,
      Little Mountain is all that’s left. Initially opened as an art space, it ran
      comfortably for over two decades until the building was sold off to developers.
      Even before that happened, the comedy rooms had been selling out, and the organization
      had been looking to move for years.</i><br><br><i>And then COVID happened, and
      everything stalled. Little Mountain survived through it all, to “do a run of
      whatever that was” after the initial lockdown ended, but they were evicted in
      January 2022 <strong>(</strong><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.straight.com/arts/little-mountain-gallery-finds-new-lease-on-life-in-gastown\"

      Mountain Gallery (LMG) to our commercial property portfolio of market, non-profit
      and social enterprise tenants. Previously located in Little Mountain (hence
      the name) LMG is a long-standing non-profit performance arts organization dedicated
      to showcasing and supporting emerging comedic talent in Vancouver. Their new
      Gastown location will more than double the capacity of what they previously
      had off of Main Street - but don’t expect a new name.</p><p>LMG is moving into
      the commercial space in the Gastown Hotel, located at 110 Water Street a few
      steps west of Abbott Street. This heritage-designated building was renovated
      by BC Housing in 2014 under a public-private partnership called the SRO Renewal
      Initiative and included 95 SRO supportive housing units.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In
      joining the CIRES portfolio, LMG has agreed to a number of substantial social
      benefit commitments for residents of the building, neighbourhood and broader
      community. Residents will be able to sit in the audience as many tickets will
      be distributed throughout the year. An annual fundraiser will generate resources
      for a local community service organization and other commitments make buying
      and hiring locally, a priority.&nbsp;</p><p>With LMG now a part of CIRES' portfolio,
      the local comedy performance art scene in Vancouver is bound to flourish and
      grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.straight.com/arts/little-mountain-gallery-finds-new-lease-on-life-in-gastown\"><strong><i>Read

      for retail, with a recent surge in foot traffic and a growing number of new
      shops and restaurants. The area's rich history, charming cobblestone streets,

      alike. However, some are calling for a major facelift of the neighbourhood,
      arguing that it needs to evolve to meet the demands of modern consumers.</p><p>Gastown
      has a mix of independent boutiques and established brands, making it a popular
      destination for shoppers seeking unique finds. The area's food and drink scene
      is also thriving, with a range of cafes, bars, and restaurants catering to a
      variety of tastes. Despite this, some argue that Gastown needs to update its
      retail offerings and modernize its infrastructure to remain competitive in today's
      retail landscape.</p><p>As Gastown's popularity continues to grow, so do concerns
      about its future. Some locals worry that the area's unique character could be
      lost if it becomes too commercialized, while others argue that a major facelift
      is necessary to ensure its long-term viability. As the debate continues, one
      thing is certain: Gastown's retail scene is evolving, and it will be interesting

    body: '<p>In a city like Vancouver, real estate is inevitably at the centre of
      any discussion regarding the liveability of the City. The residential affordability
      crisis rightly takes centre stage in conversations around the future viability
      of neighbourhoods and their potential to provide a home to all residents. However,
      there is a parallel crisis in commercial real estate affordability that is often
      overlooked. Rising lease rates make it incredibly difficult for non-profits,
      social enterprises and, small businesses to remain in community close to the
      constituents they serve. In neighbourhoods like the Downtown Eastside that means
      residents are losing access to affordable goods and services and growing increasingly
      disconnected from the place they call home. Community Impact Real Estate was
      created to think differently about commercial real estate, disrupt the traditional
      leasing model and, work towards fostering inclusive local economies that provide
      opportunities for all residents to thrive and prosper. This session will examine
      the CIRES model and unpack the way commercial real estate can be leveraged to
      create cohesive, whole communities.</p><p><img title="CIRES_SFU_CED_Steve_Johns..."
