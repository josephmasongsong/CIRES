    and communities by curating a balanced portfolio of commercial spaces.

  content/list/Goals blurb: How we achieve our mission
  content/list/Block 1 header: Strive for excellence by operating a well managed organization
    that is responsible and successful
  content/list/Block 1 blurb: CIRES is incorporated as a non-profit society, as such
    our primary purpose is to serve and enhance the public welfare rather than provide
    any financial value to private owners or shareholders. As a social enterprise
    commercial property management company, we blend the operating of the highest
    level of business services, professionalism, and fiscal responsibility with achieving
    our social value outcomes.
  content/list/Block 2 header: Grow and diversify the amount of commercial space in
    the portfolio
  content/list/Block 2 blurb: Attract and acquire new clients and assets to the portfolio
    and diversify the type of space to include a variety of sizes that accommodate
    different uses.
  content/list/Block 3 header: Lead and support Community Economic Development initiatives

    multiple partners and actors sharing our Community Economic Development vision.

    economies.

    service providers and social enterprises. The income generated by the market-value

    rates in exchange for the social and economic impact created through their business
    or program services.
